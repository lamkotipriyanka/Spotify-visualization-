# Data visualization project
A data visualization project that acquires the data from Kaggle (an open source platform) of top hit songs of 2023. Here we perform data visualization by following through these steps:
#### 1. Acquire  - We import all the necessary libraries and acquire data 
#### 2. Parse - Here we parse the data to presnt it in a structured format
#### 3. Filter - As we dont really require the whole data as it is we filter the dataset according to what the questions asked
#### 4. Mine - Mining the data means getting the important attributes of data
#### 5. Represent - Here, we have represnted our data in various ways : Pie chart ,Wordcloud ,wordcloud(in shape of the spotify logo) ,Histogram 
#### 6. Refine - We have to refine our data as to highlight what we want to show
